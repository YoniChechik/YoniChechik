🏗️ I consider myself as an “AI Architect”- helping companies push algo, AI and computer vision pipelines to production.

💪 I do everything hands-on but I talk about my company in the plural form because of my extensive web of connections that enhance the deliverables when needed: from MLOps & annotations to front-end.

⛳ I'm also a lecturer for Computer-Vision & AI at the Academic College of Tel-Aviv Yeffo, and in the past I've worked at Trigo, Microsoft, and Intel as an algo researcher. I hold B.Sc. & M.Sc. in electrical engineering from the Technion, both summa cum laude.
