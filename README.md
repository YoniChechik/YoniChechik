üèóÔ∏è I consider myself as an ‚ÄúAI Architect‚Äù- helping companies push algo, AI and computer vision pipelines to production.

üí™ I do everything hands-on but I talk about my company in the plural form because of my extensive web of connections that enhance the deliverables when needed: from MLOps & annotations to front-end.

‚õ≥ I'm also a lecturer for Computer-Vision & AI at the Academic College of Tel-Aviv Yeffo, and in the past I've worked at Trigo, Microsoft, and Intel as an algo researcher. I hold B.Sc. & M.Sc. in electrical engineering from the Technion, both summa cum laude.

üíª I also try to give back to the open source comunnity with some approved PRs:
